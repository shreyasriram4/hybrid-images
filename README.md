# Hybrid Images Project

## Overview
This project involves creating hybrid images through image filtering techniques as part of Cornell's CS5670 course. The goal is to blend high-frequency components of one image with low-frequency components of another, resulting in images that change perception with viewing distance.

## Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

Execute the script to generate hybrid images:
```bash
python hybrid.py
```

## Running the GUI

Execute this command to visualise and adjust parameters on the GUI:
```bash
python gui.py -t resources/sample-correspondance.json -c resources/sample-config.json
```
